# Thread Safety Best Practices in C++

This document outlines the thread safety patterns and best practices implemented in our text editor project.

## Core Thread Safety Patterns

### 1. Reader-Writer Lock Pattern

We've implemented a reader-writer lock pattern using `std::shared_mutex` to allow multiple concurrent readers while ensuring exclusive write access:

```cpp
// Thread-safe registry access with read-write lock for better concurrency
mutable std::shared_mutex registry_mutex_;

// Shared (read) lock - allows multiple concurrent readers
std::shared_lock<std::shared_mutex> lock(mutex_);  

// Exclusive (write) lock - only one writer at a time
std::unique_lock<std::shared_mutex> lock(mutex_);
```

This pattern significantly improves concurrency when read operations are more frequent than write operations.

### 2. Atomic Operations with Memory Ordering

We use atomic variables with explicit memory ordering semantics to ensure thread-safe access without full mutex locking:

```cpp
// Atomic storage with release ordering (makes writes visible to other threads)
highlighter_.store(highlighter, std::memory_order_release);

// Atomic load with acquire ordering (ensures visibility of previous writes)
bool enabled = enabled_.load(std::memory_order_acquire);
```

Key memory ordering semantics:
- `memory_order_acquire`: Ensures this thread sees all memory operations that happened-before a store
- `memory_order_release`: Ensures all previous memory operations in this thread are visible after this operation
- `memory_order_seq_cst`: Full memory fence for complete ordering (most expensive)

### 3. Meyer's Singleton Pattern

For thread-safe initialization of singletons, we use Scott Meyer's Singleton pattern which is guaranteed to be thread-safe in C++11 and later:

```cpp
static SyntaxHighlighterRegistry& getInstance() {
    // C++11 guarantees thread-safe initialization of static locals
    static SyntaxHighlighterRegistry instance;
    std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_acquire);
    return instance;
}
```

### 4. Non-Recursive Locks & Lock-Free Helper Methods

To prevent deadlocks from reentrant calls, we create separate "no-lock" versions of methods:

```cpp
// Public method acquires a lock
void invalidateAllLines() {
    std::unique_lock<std::shared_mutex> lock(mutex_);
    invalidateAllLines_nolock();  // Calls no-lock version
}

// Private helper doesn't try to acquire lock
void invalidateAllLines_nolock() {
    // Implementation without locking
}
```

### 5. Thread-Local Storage

For thread-specific data that shouldn't be shared, we use thread-local storage:

```cpp
// Thread-local random number generator
thread_local std::mt19937 rng{std::random_device{}()};
```

### 6. Robust Exception Handling

We wrap all thread-sensitive code in try-catch blocks to prevent exceptions from escaping threads:

```cpp
try {
    // Thread-sensitive operations
} catch (const std::exception& ex) {
    logCriticalError("operationName", ex.what());
    // Provide sensible fallback
} catch (...) {
    logCriticalError("operationName", "Unknown exception");
    // Provide sensible fallback
}
```

## Testing Thread Safety

We've implemented a comprehensive testing approach:

1. **Concurrent Stress Testing**: Creating multiple threads simultaneously to increase interaction likelihood
2. **Resource Limiting**: Preventing too many concurrent editors to avoid resource exhaustion
3. **Timeout Detection**: Monitoring for deadlocks with explicit timeouts
4. **Atomic Coordination**: Using atomic variables for thread coordination
5. **Condition Variables**: For thread synchronization and signaling

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Race Conditions**: Avoid accessing shared data without proper synchronization
2. **Recursive Mutex Issues**: Be aware of reentrant code that could cause deadlocks
3. **Order of Lock Acquisition**: Always acquire locks in the same order to prevent deadlocks
4. **Atomic vs. Non-atomic**: Don't mix atomic and non-atomic operations on the same data
5. **Memory Ordering**: Be explicit about memory ordering requirements

## Performance Considerations

1. **Fine-grained Locking**: Lock only what needs protection, not entire objects
2. **Reader Preference**: Use reader-writer locks when reads are more common than writes
3. **Lock-free When Possible**: Use atomic operations for simple state
4. **Minimize Critical Sections**: Keep locked code sections as small as possible
5. **Atomic vs. Mutex**: Atomics are faster but offer less protection than mutexes
