// This is a mock representation of how to register the ThreadSafeTextBuffer
// with a dependency injection container. The actual implementation will depend
// on the specific DI framework used in the project.

// Example with a hypothetical DI framework
class DIContainer {
public:
    template<typename Interface, typename Implementation>
    void registerType() {
        // Register Implementation as a provider for Interface
        std::cout << "Registering " << typeid(Implementation).name() 
                  << " as " << typeid(Interface).name() << std::endl;
    }

    std::shared_ptr<Interface> resolve() {
        // In a real DI container, this would return the registered implementation
        return nullptr;
    }
};

// Example function that would be called during application startup
void registerTextBufferServices(DIContainer& container) {
    // Register ThreadSafeTextBuffer as the implementation of ITextBuffer
    container.registerType<ITextBuffer, ThreadSafeTextBuffer>();
    
    // If the original TextBuffer is still needed in some contexts,
    // it could be registered with a different name
    // container.registerType<TextBuffer, TextBuffer>("RawTextBuffer");
    
    std::cout << "ThreadSafeTextBuffer has been registered as the implementation of ITextBuffer" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "All components requesting ITextBuffer will now receive the thread-safe version" << std::endl;
}

// In a real application, this would be in main.cpp or a startup file
void configureApplication() {
    DIContainer container;
    
    // Register all services
    registerTextBufferServices(container);
    
    // ... register other services
    
    // Use the container to resolve dependencies
    std::shared_ptr<ITextBuffer> buffer = container.resolve<ITextBuffer>();
    // The resolved buffer will be a ThreadSafeTextBuffer

/*
 * Notes for integration with an actual DI system:
 *
 * 1. Find the appropriate application module or container configuration file
 * 2. Locate where TextBuffer is registered as an implementation of ITextBuffer
 * 3. Replace this registration with ThreadSafeTextBuffer
 * 4. If both implementations are needed, register TextBuffer with a different name
 * 5. Update any direct TextBuffer creation code to use the DI container instead
 *
 * Example with a real DI framework like Boost.DI might look like:
 *
 * auto injector = di::make_injector(
 *     di::bind<ITextBuffer>().to<ThreadSafeTextBuffer>()
 * );
