# Potential Future Enhancements

This document outlines potential high-level directions for future development of the text editor, focusing on significant enhancements to its capabilities, performance, and maintainability.

## I. Core Editor & Feature Development

1.  **Advanced Text Editing Features:**
    *   Sophisticated cursor behaviors (e.g., multiple cursors, rectangular selection).
    *   Code-aware navigation (e.g., jump to definition, find references - potentially via LSP).
    *   Advanced search/replace (e.g., regex lookahead/lookbehind, multi-file search).

2.  **Plugin Architecture for Extensibility:**
    *   Design and implement a robust plugin system to allow third-party extensions (e.g., new language support, linters, formatters, custom tools).
    *   Requires a stable plugin API, discovery mechanism, and potentially sandboxing.

3.  **Enhanced Syntax Highlighting Engine:**
    *   Support for a wider range of programming languages (potentially via TextMate grammars or similar).
    *   Semantic highlighting (leveraging code analysis for more accurate tokenization).
    *   User-customizable themes and highlighting rules.

4.  **Basic Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
    *   Develop a simple, cross-platform GUI wrapper for the editor core.
    *   Focus on essential UI elements: text area, menus, file dialogs, status bar.

5.  **Workspace & Project Management:**
    *   Ability to open and manage folders as projects.
    *   Basic project-wide operations (e.g., search in project files).

## II. Performance & Stability

1.  **Advanced Performance Optimizations:**
    *   Explore lock-free algorithms or RCU (Read-Copy-Update) for critical data structures if profiling indicates contention.
    *   Memory optimization: custom allocators, object pooling for high-frequency objects, `std::string_view` adoption.
    *   Parallelize suitable operations (e.g., syntax highlighting of different regions, file loading/parsing).

2.  **Comprehensive Testing Strategies:**
    *   Implement property-based testing for core algorithms.
    *   Introduce fuzz testing to discover edge cases in parsing and input handling.
    *   Develop automated memory leak detection for long-running sessions.

3.  **Robust Error Recovery & Persistence:**
    *   Implement state recovery mechanisms for critical operations.
    *   Automatic backups during editing sessions and crash recovery for unsaved changes.

4.  **Integrated Performance Profiling & Diagnostics:**
    *   Embed instrumentation for performance measurement of key operations.
    *   Develop tools or visualizations for performance data and runtime diagnostics.
    *   Establish performance regression tests and configurable performance budgets.

## III. Code Quality, Build System, & Developer Experience

1.  **Continuous Code Quality & Modernization:**
    *   Proactively address compiler warnings and static analysis issues.
    *   Regularly review and refactor for `const`-correctness, smart pointer usage, and modern C++ idioms.
    *   Maintain comprehensive API documentation (Doxygen or similar) and architectural diagrams.

2.  **Build System & Dependency Management Modernization:**
    *   Ensure CMake practices remain current (e.g., target-based properties, modern find_package usage).
    *   Streamline dependency management (e.g., using CMake's FetchContent or a package manager like Conan/vcpkg if external dependencies grow).
    *   Full sanitizer support (ASan, TSan, UBSan, MSan) across all relevant build configurations and platforms.

3.  **Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Automated performance benchmarking within CI.
    *   Integration of more advanced static analysis tools (e.g., Clang-Tidy, SonarQube) in the CI pipeline.
    *   Automated release packaging and deployment processes.

4.  **Structured Logging & Monitoring:**
    *   Implement a comprehensive structured logging framework throughout the codebase.
    *   Collect runtime performance metrics for monitoring and diagnostics.
