# Text Editor Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the strategic plan to enhance the text editor, prioritizing backend stability and performance, followed by GUI development and final polishing. The primary goal is a highly stable, performant editor.

## Phase 1: Core Backend Solidification (Largely Complete)
*Focus: Establishing a rock-solid foundation with robust error handling, efficient command processing, and performant core features.*

### 1.1 Robust Error Handling
- [x] Standardized error reporting and propagation.
- [x] Input validation and graceful degradation for operations.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Consolidate all error/exception logging through `ErrorReporter` (from `EditorError.h`), refactoring `handleError` and `logManager` utilities to use it.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Ensure all `TextBuffer` methods use consistent `EditorException` derivatives for errors.
- [x] **Refinement:** Fix `try-catch` block in `src/EditorTest.cpp` (or its replacement test files).

### 1.2 Optimized Command Management
- [x] Efficient command history (pruning, memory limits).
- [x] Reliable undo/redo performance.
- [ ] Further optimization for command execution on very large files.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Consolidate `DeleteTextCommand`, `DeleteForwardCommand` into a single `DeleteCharCommand(bool isBackspace)`. Remove old versions.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Clarify `AddLineCommand` (for append) and `NewLineCommand` (for split) responsibilities.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Improve `InsertTextCommand::undo()` efficiency (e.g., `TextBuffer::deleteRange`).
- [x] **Refinement:** Remove hardcoded test logic from `CutCommand` in `EditorCommands.h`.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Make `CommandManager::maxHistory_` `static constexpr` or runtime configurable.

### 1.3 Performant Syntax Highlighting
- [x] Incremental highlighting (visible/modified lines only).
- [x] Caching and timeout/cancellation mechanisms.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Simplify `SyntaxHighlightingManager::highlighter_` member type for clear ownership/observation.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Integrate `Editor`'s highlighting cache fully into `SyntaxHighlightingManager`, removing redundancy from `Editor.cpp`.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Investigate `shared_ptr::reset()` for evicted cache entries in `SyntaxHighlightingManager::cleanupCache()` for better memory management.

### 1.4 Core Text Input & Operations
- [x] Optimized `typeText`/`typeChar` for bulk operations.
- [ ] Refine cursor positioning logic for all edge cases.
- [ ] Enhance selection and clipboard interactions (complex scenarios).
- [ ] Line wrapping (optional performance consideration).
- [~] **Refinement:** Prevent potential division by zero in `Editor::Editor()` (display dimension calculation). *(Conceptual fix applied, requires manual review and adaptation)*
- [x] **Refinement:** Add input validation for `std::getline` in `main.cpp` / `Editor::run()`.

### 1.5 API Clarity & Build Practices (Ongoing)
- [ ] **Refinement:** Replace magic numbers (UI layout, etc.) with named constants or configuration.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Minimize header includes and move implementations from headers to `.cpp` files (e.g., `EditorCommands.h`, `SyntaxHighlighter.h`) to improve build times and encapsulation.

## Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing & Validation
*Focus: Ensuring reliability and performance through rigorous testing regimes before major new features.*

### 2.1 Performance Benchmarking & Profiling
- [ ] Establish benchmarks for key operations (file load, search, typing, highlighting).
- [ ] Test across various file sizes (e.g., 1KB to 10MB+).
- [ ] Profile and identify/address remaining bottlenecks.

### 2.2 Stability & Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Develop stress tests for high-load scenarios.
- [ ] Implement fuzz testing for input handling and parsing.
- [ ] Validate memory usage over extended sessions; ensure no resource leaks.

### 2.3 Unit & Integration Testing Strategy (Foundation for Phase 2)
- [ ] **Refinement Task:** Select and integrate a C++ unit testing framework (e.g., GoogleTest, Catch2).
- [ ] **Refinement Task:** Develop comprehensive unit tests for:
    - `TextBuffer` (all methods, edge cases).
    - Individual Commands (`execute`/`undo`, edge cases, clipboard interactions).
    - `CommandManager` (undo/redo stack, limits).
    - `Editor` facade methods (command dispatching, core logic).
    - Syntax highlighting components (`SyntaxHighlighter` implementations, `SyntaxHighlightingManager` caching/invalidation/timeout).
    - File I/O operations (`Editor::openFile`, `Editor::saveFile`).
- [ ] **Refinement Task:** Ensure all test-specific code (like in `CutCommand`) is removed from production logic; tests must verify generic behavior.
- [ ] **Refinement Task:** Utilize framework assertions for automated verification.

## Phase 3: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Integration
*Focus: Developing a responsive and intuitive GUI on top of the stable backend.*

### 3.1 UI Architecture & Backend Interface
- [ ] Design a clean, decoupled interface between backend editor logic and the GUI.
- [ ] Define an event system/observer pattern for state changes and updates.
- [ ] Create view models or similar abstractions for GUI data representation.

### 3.2 GUI Implementation (Initial)
- [ ] Integrate with a chosen C++ GUI framework (e.g., Qt, wxWidgets, or a minimal library).
- [ ] Implement core editor view with text rendering and input handling.
- [ ] Ensure syntax highlighting is correctly displayed in the GUI.
- [ ] Optimize rendering for large files and maintain UI responsiveness.

### 3.3 Advanced UI Features
- [ ] Line numbers, code folding.
- [ ] Multiple tabs/documents management.
- [ ] Split view editing.
- [ ] Basic theme customization.

## Phase 4: Final Polishing & Release Preparation
*Focus: Addressing final quality aspects, documentation, and preparing for a potential release.*

### 4.1 Documentation Completion
- [ ] Final review and update of all code/API documentation.
- [ ] Create a comprehensive User Guide.
- [ ] Document key architectural decisions and system design.

### 4.2 Performance Tuning & Optimization
- [ ] Final performance optimization pass based on profiling.
- [ ] Memory usage analysis and refinement.
- [ ] Startup time improvements.

### 4.3 Release Readiness
- [ ] Thorough code cleanup, removal of debug-specific code.
- [ ] Finalize build system for release configurations (all platforms).
- [ ] Consider packaging/distribution methods.

## Key Success Criteria

- Handles large files (e.g., 10MB+) without noticeable operational slowdowns.
- No crashes or hangs during typical and stress-test usage.
- Command history memory usage is bounded and configurable.
- Syntax highlighting does not freeze or significantly lag the UI.
- Text input and core editing commands are consistently responsive.

## High-Level Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Core Backend):** Largely complete. Ongoing refinements as needed.
- **Phase 2 (Testing & Validation):** Next major focus.
- **Phase 3 (GUI Integration):** To commence after robust backend validation.
- **Phase 4 (Final Polishing):** Prior to any potential "1.0" release.
