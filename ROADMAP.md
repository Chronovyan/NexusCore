# Text Editor Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the strategic plan to enhance the text editor, prioritizing backend stability and performance, followed by GUI development and final polishing. The primary goal is a highly stable, performant editor.

## Phase 1: Core Backend Solidification (Largely Complete)
*Focus: Establishing a rock-solid foundation with robust error handling, efficient command processing, and performant core features.*

### 1.1 Robust Error Handling
- [x] Standardized error reporting and propagation.
- [x] Input validation and graceful degradation for operations.

### 1.2 Optimized Command Management
- [x] Efficient command history (pruning, memory limits).
- [x] Reliable undo/redo performance.
- [ ] Further optimization for command execution on very large files.

### 1.3 Performant Syntax Highlighting
- [x] Incremental highlighting (visible/modified lines only).
- [x] Caching and timeout/cancellation mechanisms.

### 1.4 Core Text Input & Operations
- [x] Optimized `typeText`/`typeChar` for bulk operations.
- [ ] Refine cursor positioning logic for all edge cases.
- [ ] Enhance selection and clipboard interactions (complex scenarios).
- [ ] Line wrapping (optional performance consideration).

## Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing & Validation
*Focus: Ensuring reliability and performance through rigorous testing regimes before major new features.*

### 2.1 Performance Benchmarking & Profiling
- [ ] Establish benchmarks for key operations (file load, search, typing, highlighting).
- [ ] Test across various file sizes (e.g., 1KB to 10MB+).
- [ ] Profile and identify/address remaining bottlenecks.

### 2.2 Stability & Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Develop stress tests for high-load scenarios.
- [ ] Implement fuzz testing for input handling and parsing.
- [ ] Validate memory usage over extended sessions; ensure no resource leaks.

## Phase 3: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Integration
*Focus: Developing a responsive and intuitive GUI on top of the stable backend.*

### 3.1 UI Architecture & Backend Interface
- [ ] Design a clean, decoupled interface between backend editor logic and the GUI.
- [ ] Define an event system/observer pattern for state changes and updates.
- [ ] Create view models or similar abstractions for GUI data representation.

### 3.2 GUI Implementation (Initial)
- [ ] Integrate with a chosen C++ GUI framework (e.g., Qt, wxWidgets, or a minimal library).
- [ ] Implement core editor view with text rendering and input handling.
- [ ] Ensure syntax highlighting is correctly displayed in the GUI.
- [ ] Optimize rendering for large files and maintain UI responsiveness.

### 3.3 Advanced UI Features
- [ ] Line numbers, code folding.
- [ ] Multiple tabs/documents management.
- [ ] Split view editing.
- [ ] Basic theme customization.

## Phase 4: Final Polishing & Release Preparation
*Focus: Addressing final quality aspects, documentation, and preparing for a potential release.*

### 4.1 Documentation Completion
- [ ] Final review and update of all code/API documentation.
- [ ] Create a comprehensive User Guide.
- [ ] Document key architectural decisions and system design.

### 4.2 Performance Tuning & Optimization
- [ ] Final performance optimization pass based on profiling.
- [ ] Memory usage analysis and refinement.
- [ ] Startup time improvements.

### 4.3 Release Readiness
- [ ] Thorough code cleanup, removal of debug-specific code.
- [ ] Finalize build system for release configurations (all platforms).
- [ ] Consider packaging/distribution methods.

## Key Success Criteria

- Handles large files (e.g., 10MB+) without noticeable operational slowdowns.
- No crashes or hangs during typical and stress-test usage.
- Command history memory usage is bounded and configurable.
- Syntax highlighting does not freeze or significantly lag the UI.
- Text input and core editing commands are consistently responsive.

## High-Level Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Core Backend):** Largely complete. Ongoing refinements as needed.
- **Phase 2 (Testing & Validation):** Next major focus.
- **Phase 3 (GUI Integration):** To commence after robust backend validation.
- **Phase 4 (Final Polishing):** Prior to any potential "1.0" release.
