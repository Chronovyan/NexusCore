# Text Editor Improvement Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines our plan to enhance the text editor, focusing on critical backend improvements first, followed by GUI integration. The goal is to create a stable, performant editor that doesn't hang or crash during operation.

## Phase 1: Core Backend Improvements

### 1.1 Error Handling Enhancements
- [x] Replace silent catch blocks with proper error handling in Editor.cpp
- [x] Add robust validation for user inputs and operations
- [x] Implement graceful degradation for operations that might fail
- [x] Create standardized error reporting mechanism

### 1.2 Command Management Optimization
- [x] Implement efficient command history pruning
- [x] Add memory usage limits for command history
- [ ] Optimize command execution for large files
- [x] Improve undo/redo performance

### 1.3 Syntax Highlighting Performance
- [x] Rewrite syntax highlighting to only process visible lines
- [x] Implement incremental highlighting (only re-highlight modified lines)
- [x] Add caching mechanism with invalidation triggers
- [x] Create timeout/cancellation for long-running highlighting operations

### 1.4 Text Input Handling
- [x] Optimize typeText/typeChar methods for bulk operations
- [ ] Improve cursor positioning logic
- [ ] Enhance selection and clipboard functionality
- [ ] Add efficient line wrapping (optional)

## Phase 2: Testing & Validation

### 2.1 Performance Testing
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for common operations
- [ ] Test with files of various sizes (1KB - 10MB)
- [ ] Profile and identify remaining bottlenecks
- [ ] Document performance improvements

### 2.2 Stability Testing
- [ ] Create stress tests for common operations
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Validate memory usage over extended sessions
- [ ] Ensure no resource leaks

## Phase 3: GUI Integration

### 3.1 UI Architecture
- [ ] Design clean interface between backend and GUI
- [ ] Define event system for editor state changes
- [ ] Create view models for GUI representation
- [ ] Implement observer pattern for updates

### 3.2 GUI Implementation
- [ ] Integrate with existing GUI framework
- [ ] Implement syntax highlighting in the GUI
- [ ] Add efficient rendering for large files
- [ ] Create responsive UI that doesn't block during operations

### 3.3 Advanced UI Features
- [ ] Line numbers
- [ ] Code folding
- [ ] Multiple tabs/documents
- [ ] Split view
- [ ] Customizable themes

## Phase 4: Final Polishing

### 4.1 Documentation
- [ ] Update code documentation
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Document architecture and design decisions

### 4.2 Performance Tuning
- [ ] Final optimization pass
- [ ] Memory usage analysis and optimization
- [ ] Startup time improvements

### 4.3 Release Preparation
- [ ] Code cleanup
- [ ] Remove debug code
- [ ] Prepare build system for release

## Success Criteria
- Editor can handle files up to 10MB without noticeable slowdown
- No crashes or hangs during normal operation
- Command history uses bounded memory
- Syntax highlighting doesn't cause UI freezes
- User inputs (typing, etc.) are always responsive

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Backend Improvements - Current focus
- Phase 2: Testing & Validation - Start after Phase 1 milestone completion
- Phase 3: GUI Integration - Start after Phase 2 milestone completion
- Phase 4: Final Polishing - Start after Phase 3 milestone completion
