# AI-First TextEditor: Development Roadmap

This document outlines our comprehensive plan to evolve the AI-First TextEditor from its current state to a fully-featured, production-ready application. The plan is divided into four phases, each focusing on specific aspects of improvement.

## Overall Progress: Phase 2 (Completed)

- ✅ **Phase 1**: Code Stabilization (Completed)
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Comprehensive Testing & Validation (Completed)
- ⏱️ **Phase 3**: Architecture Refinement (Planned)
- ⏱️ **Phase 4**: Feature Expansion (Planned)

## Phase 1: Code Stabilization ✅

**Focus**: Clean up the codebase, complete current testing initiatives, and establish a solid foundation for future enhancements.

### 1.1 Code Cleanup ✅
- ✅ Remove redundant files (`.bak`, `_fixed`, `_new` variants)
- ✅ Create consistent error handling strategy document
- ✅ Apply consistent error handling pattern to all components
- ✅ Ensure proper file organization (move misplaced files)

### 1.2 Refactoring Large Classes ✅
- ✅ Break down `Editor.cpp` into smaller, focused components
- ✅ Refactor `AIAgentOrchestrator.cpp`
- ✅ Improve state machine implementation in AI components

### 1.3 Memory Management Enhancement ✅
- ✅ Audit manual memory management across codebase
- ✅ Convert raw pointers to smart pointers where appropriate
- ✅ Implement RAII pattern consistently throughout the codebase

### Implementation Details

#### Remove Test-Specific Code ✅
- ✅ Removed special handling in `Editor.cpp` - `deleteWord()` method
- ✅ Removed `fixDeleteWordForTest` function from EditorCommands.cpp
- ✅ Removed special case handling in `CppHighlighter::highlightLine`

#### Standardize Error Handling ✅
- ✅ Implemented consistent approach using exceptions for error conditions
- ✅ Updated methods in TextBuffer.cpp to use consistent error handling:
  - `deleteLine`: Now throws exceptions for out-of-range access
  - `replaceLine`: Now throws exceptions for out-of-range access
- ✅ Added clear documentation about error handling behavior

#### Fix Command Behavior ✅
- ✅ Implemented correct undo logic for InsertArbitraryTextCommand
- ✅ Added tests to verify undo behavior for multi-line insertions
- ✅ Fixed DeleteCharCommand role and behavior
- ✅ Fixed DecreaseIndentCommand selection logic

#### Standardize Logging ✅
- ✅ Created a consistent logging interface with ErrorReporter
- ✅ Implemented asynchronous logging for improved performance
- ✅ Added configurable log levels and destinations

## Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing & Validation 🔄

**Focus**: Ensure code quality and reliability through comprehensive testing.

### 2.1 Improved Syntax Highlighting Tests ✅
- ✅ SyntaxHighlighterRegistry tests
- ✅ SyntaxHighlightingManager tests
- ✅ Fixed const-correctness issues in `setVisibleRange` method

### 2.2 File I/O Operation Tests ✅
- ✅ Basic file operations (open, save, etc.)
- ✅ Advanced file scenarios (line endings, large files)

### 2.3 Performance and Stress Testing ✅
- ✅ Memory usage monitoring
- ✅ Long-running stability tests
- ✅ Large edit stress tests
- ✅ Additional testing for very large files (>10MB)

### 2.4 Fuzz Testing ✅
- ✅ Random input generation
- ✅ Test with various editor states
- ✅ Error handling validation

### 2.5 Memory Leak Detection ✅
- ✅ Memory tracking framework
- ✅ Test scenarios for buffer operations
- ✅ Analysis functions for detecting leaks

### 2.6 Test Framework Consolidation ✅
- ✅ Created test consolidation plan
- ✅ Updated CMakeLists.txt to include all test files
- ✅ Created script to automate test execution and reporting
- ✅ Convert remaining manual tests to automated tests

## Phase 3: Architecture Refinement (Planned)

**Focus**: Improve core architecture to enhance extensibility, testability, and maintainability.

### 3.1 Dependency Injection Framework
- [ ] Design dependency injection system appropriate for C++
- [ ] Refactor components to use the DI system
- [ ] Create factory classes for major components

### 3.2 Plugin Architecture

- [ ] Design and document thread ownership model
- [ ] Implement thread-safe communication patterns
- [ ] Add stress tests for concurrent operations

### 3.4 Command Queue System
- [ ] Enhance command system with priority queue
- [ ] Add command batching support
- [ ] Implement transactional command execution
- [ ] Add command history visualization

## Phase 4: Feature Expansion (Planned)

**Focus**: Add new capabilities to make the editor more powerful and AI-integrated.

### 4.1 Multi-Model Support
- [ ] Abstract AI provider interface
- [ ] Add support for local models (LLama)
- [ ] Implement model selection and switching
- [ ] Add model-specific prompt templates

### 4.2 Context-Aware Assistance
- [ ] Implement codebase indexing
