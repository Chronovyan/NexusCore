# Text Editor Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the strategic plan to enhance the text editor, prioritizing backend stability and performance, followed by GUI development and final polishing. The primary goal is a highly stable, performant editor.

## Phase 1: Core Backend Solidification (Largely Complete)
*Focus: Establishing a rock-solid foundation with robust error handling, efficient command processing, and performant core features.*

### 1.1 Robust Error Handling
- [x] Standardized error reporting and propagation.
- [x] Input validation and graceful degradation for operations.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Consolidate all error/exception logging through `ErrorReporter` (from `EditorError.h`), refactoring `handleError` and `logManager` utilities to use it.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Ensure all `TextBuffer` methods use consistent `EditorException` derivatives for errors.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Review `TextBuffer::getLine()` (non-const) and `TextBuffer::setLine()` to ensure they throw `std::out_of_range` for invalid indices, as per test expectations. (Currently might have unsafe behavior).
- [x] **Refinement:** Fix `try-catch` block in `src/EditorTest.cpp` (or its replacement test files). (File deleted, N/A)

### 1.2 Optimized Command Management
- [x] Efficient command history (pruning, memory limits).
- [x] Reliable undo/redo performance.
- [ ] Further optimization for command execution on very large files.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Finalize consolidation of `DeleteTextCommand`, `DeleteForwardCommand` into `DeleteCharCommand(bool isBackspace)` by removing old command class code if `DeleteCharCommand` is confirmed as the standard.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Resolve redundancy between `AddLineCommand()` (default constructor for split) and `NewLineCommand`. Prefer one for splitting (likely `NewLineCommand`) and simplify/refactor `AddLineCommand`.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Improve `InsertTextCommand::undo()` efficiency (e.g., `TextBuffer::deleteRange`).
- [x] **Refinement:** Remove hardcoded test logic from `CutCommand` in `EditorCommands.h`.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Make `CommandManager::maxHistory_` `static constexpr` or runtime configurable.

### 1.3 Performant Syntax Highlighting
- [x] Incremental highlighting (visible/modified lines only).
- [x] Caching and timeout/cancellation mechanisms.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Simplify `SyntaxHighlightingManager::highlighter_` member type (`std::shared_ptr<std::atomic<SyntaxHighlighter*>>`) for clear ownership/observation.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Integrate `Editor`'s highlighting cache fully into `SyntaxHighlightingManager`, removing redundancy from `Editor.cpp`.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Investigate `shared_ptr::reset()` for evicted cache entries in `SyntaxHighlightingManager::cleanupCache()` for better memory management.

### 1.4 Core Text Input & Operations
- [x] Optimized `typeText`/`typeChar` for bulk operations.
- [ ] Refine cursor positioning logic for all edge cases.
- [ ] Enhance selection and clipboard interactions (complex scenarios).
- [ ] Line wrapping (optional performance consideration).
- [ ] **Refinement:** Prevent potential division by zero in `Editor::Editor()` (display dimension calculation) - Needs Review/Confirmation of conceptual fix.
- [x] **Refinement:** Add input validation for `std::getline` in `main.cpp` / `Editor::run()`.

### 1.5 API Clarity & Build Practices (Ongoing)
- [ ] **Refinement:** Replace magic numbers (UI layout, etc.) with named constants or configuration.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Minimize header includes and move implementations from headers to `.cpp` files (e.g., `EditorCommands.h`, `SyntaxHighlighter.h`) to improve build times and encapsulation.
- [ ] **Refinement:** Review and centralize command parsing logic (currently duplicated in `main.cpp`, `EditorTestable.h`, `EditorTestableFixed.h`).

## Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing & Validation
*Focus: Ensuring reliability and performance through rigorous testing regimes before major new features.*

### 2.1 Performance Benchmarking & Profiling
- [x] Establish benchmarks for key operations (file load, search, typing, highlighting). (`PerformanceBenchmark.cpp` exists)
- [~] Test across various file sizes (e.g., 1KB to 10MB+). (Capability exists via `generateLargeFile`)
- [ ] Profile and identify/address remaining bottlenecks.

### 2.2 Stability & Edge Case Testing
- [~] Develop stress tests for high-load scenarios. (`testLargeFileEditing` and `PerformanceBenchmark.cpp` are a start)
- [ ] Implement fuzz testing for input handling and parsing.
- [ ] Validate memory usage over extended sessions; ensure no resource leaks.

### 2.3 Unit & Integration Testing Strategy (Foundation for Phase 2)
- [~] **Refinement Task:** Select and integrate a C++ unit testing framework (e.g., GoogleTest, Catch2). (GTest integrated; custom framework `TestFramework.h` also in use. Consider standardizing.)
- [ ] **Refinement Task:** Develop comprehensive unit tests for:
    - [x] `TextBuffer` (all methods, edge cases). (Good coverage via GTest `textbuffer_test.cpp`)
    - [x] Individual Commands (`execute`/`undo`, edge cases, clipboard interactions). (Good coverage via GTest `editor_commands_test.cpp` and custom `CommandLogicTests.cpp`)
    - [x] `CommandManager` (undo/redo stack, limits). (Covered by `CommandManagerTests.cpp`)
    - [~] `Editor` facade methods (command dispatching, core logic). (Implicitly tested by CLI-driven tests; specific facade unit tests could be added.)
    - [ ] Syntax highlighting components (`SyntaxHighlighter` implementations, `SyntaxHighlightingManager` caching/invalidation/timeout).
    - [ ] File I/O operations (`Editor::openFile`, `Editor::saveFile` specifically).
- [x] **Refinement Task:** Ensure all test-specific code (like in `CutCommand`) is removed from production logic; tests must verify generic behavior.
- [ ] **Refinement Task:** Convert all manual CLI-driven tests (e.g., `Comprehensive*.cpp`, `SelectionClipboardTest.cpp`, etc.) to use automated assertions (e.g., via checkpoints or direct state verification).
- [ ] **Refinement Task:** Resolve `EditorTestable` usage in `FutureFeatureTests.cpp` (instantiation vs. static methods).
- [ ] **Refinement Task:** Consolidate `TextBuffer` tests, favoring the GTest version (`textbuffer_test.cpp`) over the simpler `cout`-based `TextBufferTest.cpp`.
- [ ] **Refinement Task (Optional):** Test helper classes like `TestEditor`, `EditorTestable`, `TestFramework` themselves if they grow in complexity.

## Phase 3: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Integration
*Focus: Developing a responsive and intuitive GUI on top of the stable backend.*

### 3.1 UI Architecture & Backend Interface
- [ ] Design a clean, decoupled interface between backend editor logic and the GUI.
- [ ] Define an event system/observer pattern for state changes and updates.
- [ ] Create view models or similar abstractions for GUI data representation.

### 3.2 GUI Implementation (Initial)
- [ ] Integrate with a chosen C++ GUI framework (e.g., Qt, wxWidgets, or a minimal library).
- [ ] Implement core editor view with text rendering and input handling.
- [ ] Ensure syntax highlighting is correctly displayed in the GUI.
- [ ] Optimize rendering for large files and maintain UI responsiveness.

### 3.3 Advanced UI Features
- [ ] Line numbers, code folding.
- [ ] Multiple tabs/documents management.
- [ ] Split view editing.
- [ ] Basic theme customization.

## Phase 4: Final Polishing & Release Preparation
*Focus: Addressing final quality aspects, documentation, and preparing for a potential release.*

### 4.1 Documentation Completion
- [ ] Final review and update of all code/API documentation.
- [ ] Create a comprehensive User Guide.
- [ ] Document key architectural decisions and system design.

### 4.2 Performance Tuning & Optimization
- [ ] Final performance optimization pass based on profiling.
- [ ] Memory usage analysis and refinement.
- [ ] Startup time improvements.

### 4.3 Release Readiness
- [ ] Thorough code cleanup, removal of debug-specific code.
- [ ] Finalize build system for release configurations (all platforms).
- [ ] Consider packaging/distribution methods.

## Key Success Criteria

- Handles large files (e.g., 10MB+) without noticeable operational slowdowns.
- No crashes or hangs during typical and stress-test usage.
- Command history memory usage is bounded and configurable.
- Syntax highlighting does not freeze or significantly lag the UI.
- Text input and core editing commands are consistently responsive.

## High-Level Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Core Backend):** Largely complete. Ongoing refinements as needed.
- **Phase 2 (Testing & Validation):** Next major focus.
- **Phase 3 (GUI Integration):** To commence after robust backend validation.
- **Phase 4 (Final Polishing):** Prior to any potential "1.0" release.
