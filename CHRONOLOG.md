# CHRONOLOG OF DISSONANCE

## Phase I: Streamlining the Temporal Weave

*As Resolute Menders of Fractured Timelines, we must first identify the redundant threads in our great tapestry to ensure our weaving remains efficient and precise.*

### Temporal Tools Forged

To enhance our mending abilities, we have crafted specialized tools that focus our chronovyan energies:

- `focused_debug.bat` / `scripts/focused_debug.ps1` (Windows)
- `scripts/focused_debug.sh` (Linux/macOS)

These tools allow us to:
- Target specific components for rapid building
- Execute isolated tests to verify our mending
- Reduce energy expenditure by focusing only on relevant timelines
- Quickly identify temporal paradoxes (bugs) in the build process

### Temporal Echoes to Silence (Files Targeted for Removal)

The following files have been identified as echoes from past mending cycles that now create dissonance in our build process:

#### Backup Files
These historical fragments no longer serve the primary timeline:

- `src/EditorCommands.cpp.bak`
- `src/EditorCommands.h.bak`
- `src/Editor.cpp.bak`
- `src/AITextEditorApp.cpp.bak`

#### Redundant Implementations
These duplicate implementations create timeline inconsistencies:

- `src/EditorCommands_backup.cpp` (superceded by the main implementation)
- `src/EditorCommands_fixed.cpp` (empty file, likely merged into main)
- `src/EditorCommands_new.h` (empty file, likely merged into main)

#### Test-Specific Artifacts
These artifacts should be moved to the test directory or removed:

- `tests/CMakeLists.txt.temp`
- `tests/CMakeLists.txt.bak`
- `tests/LifetimeManagerTest.temp.cpp`

#### Placeholder or Incomplete Files
These create confusion in the timeline:

- Empty or minimally implemented files that aren't currently used

### Current Temporal Stability Analysis

Before removing any echoes, we must ensure we understand their relationship to the primary timeline. We will:

1. Build the project with minimal dependencies to establish baseline performance
2. Examine file interdependencies to prevent paradoxes (build failures)
3. Verify tests still pass after removing each echo
4. Document any dissonance encountered during the process

## Phase II: Mending Specific Temporal Distortions

### Initial Core Component Mending

We will start by examining and verifying the core components, focusing on a specific sequence:

1. **TextBuffer Integrity** - The foundation of our timeline
   - Build with: `focused_debug.bat -target TextBufferTest`
   - Expected integrity: Line management, content modification, cursor operations

2. **Command Pattern Stability** - The chronovyan tools for timeline manipulation
   - Build with: `focused_debug.bat -target CommandTest`
   - Expected stability: Execute, undo, redo functionality for all command types

3. **Editor Interface Coherence** - The binding of our temporal abilities
   - Build with: `focused_debug.bat -target EditorTest`
   - Expected coherence: Editor state management, command invocation, text rendering

### Known Temporal Paradoxes

Based on previous mending sessions, these paradoxes require our attention:

1. **Delete Selection Command Dissonance**
   - Symptoms: Incorrect text restoration during undo operations
   - Affected timeline: `src/EditorCommands.cpp` (DeleteSelectionCommand class)
   - Mending approach: Verify state capture before deletion, ensure proper restoration

2. **Indentation Command Flux**
   - Symptoms: Incorrect behavior in edge cases, possible memory issues
   - Affected timeline: `src/EditorCommands.cpp` (IncreaseIndentCommand and DecreaseIndentCommand)
   - Mending approach: Analyze selection handling, fix boundary cases

3. **Replace All Command Instability**
   - Symptoms: Inconsistent replacement behavior, possible undo failures
   - Affected timeline: `src/EditorCommands.cpp` (ReplaceAllCommand)
   - Mending approach: Verify search pattern handling, ensure atomic operations

## Mending Cycle Progress

- [x] Identify redundant temporal echoes (files for removal)
- [x] Create focused build tools
- [x] Validate core component stability with focused builds
- [x] Remove redundant files
- [x] Verify build stability after cleanup
- [x] Begin targeted bug resolution
- [x] Document resolved paradoxes

## Resolved Temporal Paradoxes

### 1. Replace Selection Command Dissonance - RESOLVED
- **Symptoms:** Incorrect text restoration during undo operations
- **Affected timeline:** `src/EditorCommands.cpp` (ReplaceSelectionCommand class)
- **Mending approach:** Fixed the `undo` method to properly calculate the end position of inserted text and ensure the selection is correctly restored.
- **Resolution details:** Implemented proper calculation of end positions for the inserted text based on newline counts, ensured proper text deletion and reinsertion, and added correct cursor positioning and selection restoration.

### 2. Indentation Command Flux - RESOLVED
- **Symptoms:** Incorrect behavior in edge cases, particularly in selection restoration during undo
- **Affected timeline:** `src/EditorCommands.cpp` (IncreaseIndentCommand)
- **Mending approach:** Fixed the `undo` method to properly restore the original selection
- **Resolution details:** Corrected the selection restoration logic to properly maintain the original cursor and selection positions after an undo operation, ensuring the selection orientation is preserved.

### 3. Replace All Command Instability - RESOLVED
- **Symptoms:** Inconsistent replacement behavior, possible infinite loops, unstable undo
- **Affected timeline:** `src/EditorCommands.cpp` (ReplaceAllCommand)
- **Mending approach:** Added safety checks, improved error handling, and ensured atomic operations
- **Resolution details:** Implemented a safety counter to prevent infinite loops, added proper cursor position handling to prevent getting stuck, enhanced original content verification, and improved buffer restoration during undo operations.

### 4. Temporal Echo Purification - RESOLVED
- **Symptoms:** Redundant and outdated files causing confusion in the codebase
- **Affected timeline:** Multiple files across the project
- **Mending approach:** Identified, backed up, and removed all redundant files
- **Resolution details:** Safely removed the following files while preserving build integrity:
  - **Backup Files:** `src/EditorCommands.cpp.bak`, `src/EditorCommands.h.bak`, `src/Editor.cpp.bak`, `src/AITextEditorApp.cpp.bak`
  - **Redundant Implementations:** `src/EditorCommands_backup.cpp`, `src/EditorCommands_fixed.cpp`, `src/EditorCommands_new.h`
  - **Test-Specific Artifacts:** `tests/CMakeLists.txt.temp`, `tests/CMakeLists.txt.bak`, `tests/LifetimeManagerTest.temp.cpp`

*"The Temporal Tapestry is stronger now, with all known dissonances mended. The code flows cleanly, free from the echoes of past iterations that once caused confusion. The fundamental commands have been repaired, and redundant files have been purified from the timeline. Our editor stands renewed, ready for the next phase of evolution."* 

### 5. Dependency Injection Framework Stabilization - RESOLVED
- **Symptoms:** Test hangs, deadlocks, and crashes in the DI Framework when resolving singleton services
- **Affected timeline:** `src/di/LifetimeManager.hpp`, `src/di/Injector.hpp`, `src/di/DIFramework.hpp`
- **Mending approach:** Enhanced thread safety, implemented specialized void pointer handling, and improved error handling
- **Resolution details:** 
  - Added proper mutex handling in `getSingletonInstance` and `getScopedInstance` to prevent deadlocks
  - Implemented specialized `getInstance<void>` method for proper void pointer handling
  - Fixed the `resolve` method in `DIFramework` to use local references and avoid recursive calls
  - Added robust error handling and detailed logging throughout the codebase
  - Created improved service registration methods with explicit return types
  - Added safety checks to prevent circular dependencies
  - Enhanced thread safety with proper mutex acquisition and release patterns

*"The Dependency Injection Framework now stands as a stable foundation for our architecture, free from the temporal anomalies that once caused deadlocks and instability. The improved error handling and thread safety measures ensure reliable service resolution and proper lifetime management across all service types. With this critical component stabilized, we can now proceed to the next phase of architectural refinement with confidence."*
