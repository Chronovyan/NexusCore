# File Logging System Stress Testing Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive stress testing plan for the file logging system within the `ErrorReporter` component, specifically the `FileLogDestination` implementation with rotation capabilities.

## Overview

The file logging system has been implemented with the following features:
- Log destination abstraction allowing multiple log targets
- File-based logging with configurable paths
- Rotation based on file size, time periods (daily/weekly), or both
- Old log file cleanup based on configurable retention limits
- Thread-safety through mutex protection

While unit tests have verified the basic functionality, stress testing is needed to ensure the system's reliability, performance, and stability under high load and concurrent access conditions.

## Stress Test Objectives

1. **Verify Reliability**: Ensure the logging system operates correctly under heavy load
2. **Measure Performance**: Determine throughput and latency metrics under various conditions
3. **Test Concurrency**: Verify thread-safety and behavior with concurrent logging
4. **Validate Rotation**: Ensure log rotation functions correctly at high frequency
5. **Assess Resilience**: Test recovery from error conditions and resource constraints

## Test Scenarios

### 1. High Volume Sequential Logging (`HighVolumeSequentialLogging`)

Tests the system's ability to handle a large number of log messages with varying sizes.

- **Configuration**: 1MB max file size, 5 files maximum
- **Test Volume**: 100,000 log messages
- **Message Types**:
  - 90% small messages (~50 bytes)
  - 9% medium messages (~500 bytes)
  - 1% large messages (~5KB)
- **Measured Metrics**:
  - Total processing time
  - Throughput (messages/second)
  - File rotation behavior (count and total size)

### 2. Concurrent Logging (`ConcurrentLogging`)

Tests the thread-safety of the logging system with multiple concurrent writers.

- **Configuration**: 1MB max file size, 5 files maximum
- **Test Volume**: 8 threads Ã— 20,000 messages = 160,000 total messages
- **Measured Metrics**:
  - Total processing time
  - Throughput under concurrent load
  - Potential thread contention issues
  - File rotation correctness

### 3. Rapid Rotation (`RapidRotation`)

Tests the system's ability to handle frequent log rotations.

- **Configuration**: 1KB max file size, 10 files maximum
- **Test Volume**: 1,000 messages of ~200 bytes each
- **Expected Behavior**: ~200 rotations (5 messages per file)
- **Measured Metrics**:
  - Rotation overhead
  - Correct rotation behavior
  - File count limit enforcement

### 4. Long-Running Sustained Logging (`DISABLED_SustainedLogging`)

Tests the system's stability over a longer period with moderate traffic.

- **Configuration**: 5MB max file size, 3 files maximum
- **Test Duration**: 2 minutes
- **Log Frequency**: One message every 10ms
- **Message Size**: Varying between 100-1,000 bytes
- **Measured Metrics**:
  - Sustained throughput
  - Memory usage
  - Resource leakage
  - Overall stability

### 5. Resilience Testing (`DISABLED_ResilienceTest`)

Tests the system's recovery from error conditions.

- **Procedure**:
  1. Start logging to a directory
  2. Delete the directory during logging
  3. Continue logging (expecting recovery attempts)
  4. Recreate the directory
  5. Continue logging
- **Expected Behavior**: System should recover once the directory is available again
- **Measured Metrics**:
  - Error recovery behavior
  - Message loss during recovery
  - System stability after recovery

## Running the Tests

The stress tests are contained in the `FileLogStressTest.cpp` file and can be run separately from the main test suite:

```bash
# Build tests
cmake --build . --target FileLogStressTest

# Run all stress tests
./tests/FileLogStressTest

# Run a specific test
./tests/FileLogStressTest --gtest_filter=FileLogStressTest.HighVolumeSequentialLogging
```

Note that some tests are disabled by default (`DISABLED_` prefix) due to their long-running nature or potential for filesystem manipulation. To run these tests explicitly:

```bash
./tests/FileLogStressTest --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests
```

## Interpreting Results

The tests report detailed metrics about throughput, file counts, and total sizes. These metrics can be used to:

1. Establish baseline performance expectations
2. Compare across different OS environments
3. Detect regressions in future modifications
4. Identify scaling limits of the current implementation

## Future Enhancements

Based on stress test results, potential enhancements may include:

1. Asynchronous logging with a dedicated background thread
2. Optimizations for high-throughput scenarios
3. Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
4. Improved space management for log files
5. Write batching for improved I/O efficiency
