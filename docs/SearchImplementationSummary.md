# Search Functionality Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of search and replace functionality added to the text editor project. The feature enhances the editor with the ability to find and replace text within documents.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components Added:

1. **Search Functions in Editor Class**
   - `search(const std::string& searchTerm, bool caseSensitive = true)`
   - `searchNext()`
   - `replace(const std::string& searchTerm, const std::string& replacementText, bool caseSensitive = true)`
   - `replaceAll(const std::string& searchTerm, const std::string& replacementText, bool caseSensitive = true)`

2. **Helper Functions**
   - `findMatchInLine(const std::string& line, const std::string& term, size_t startPos, bool caseSensitive, size_t& matchPos, size_t& matchLength)`

3. **State Variables**
   - `currentSearchTerm_` - Stores the current search string
   - `currentSearchCaseSensitive_` - Tracks case sensitivity setting
   - `lastSearchLine_`, `lastSearchCol_` - Track position of last match
   - `searchWrapped_` - Indicates when search has wrapped around document

4. **Command Support Classes**
   - `ReplaceSelectionCommand` - Command for replacing selected text
   - `CompoundCommand` - Command for grouping multiple operations (used by replaceAll)

5. **Command Manager Enhancement**
   - Added `addCommand()` method to support replaceAll functionality

### Integration with Existing Features:

1. **Selection Integration**
   - Search results are highlighted using the existing selection mechanism
   - Ensures visual feedback for search results

2. **Command Processing**
   - Added command handlers for search/replace operations
   - Maintained compatibility with existing command structure
   - Resolved ambiguity between line replacement and search/replace commands

3. **Test Framework**
   - Created comprehensive tests for search functionality
   - Tests include basic search, case sensitivity, replace, and replace all
   - Used TestEditor class to enable unrestricted cursor positioning for testing

## Testing & Validation

1. **Test Cases**
   - Basic search functionality
   - Case-sensitive search
   - Single text replacement
   - Replace all occurrences
   - Selection highlighting during search

2. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Added checkpoint system to verify operations
   - Enhanced EditorTestable to support testing search operations
   - Used MSVC compiler and automated build scripts

## Documentation

1. **User-facing Documentation**
   - Added search commands to README
   - Created detailed SearchFeature.md document

2. **Code Documentation**
   - Added comments explaining search algorithm
   - Documented state variables and their purpose

## Wrap-up

The search functionality is now fully implemented and integrated with the existing editor features. The implementation follows the core design principles of the project and maintains compatibility with the existing command structure.

The tests ensure that searching, case-sensitivity, replacing, and replace-all operations work correctly, and the documentation provides clear guidance on how to use these features.
