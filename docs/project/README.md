# AI-First TextEditor Project Overview

The AI-First TextEditor is an innovative code editing environment designed from the ground up with AI integration as a core principle. This project aims to create a modern, responsive, and intelligent text editing experience that leverages AI to enhance developer productivity.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a text editor that:

1. **Makes AI a First-Class Citizen** - AI assistance is deeply integrated into the editor's core functionality, not merely an addon
2. **Reduces Context Switching** - Developers can stay in their flow by keeping AI interactions within the editor
3. **Optimizes for Real-World Development** - Practical features that solve actual development challenges
4. **Maintains High Performance** - AI features should not compromise the core editing experience

## Key Features

### Core Editor Capabilities
- Fast and responsive text editing with syntax highlighting
- Modern UI with customizable themes and layouts
- Robust command system with comprehensive undo/redo support
- Efficient file I/O with support for large files

### AI Integration
- Conversational interface for code generation and explanation
- Tool execution for real-world development tasks
- Context-aware assistance that understands your codebase
- Multi-model support for different AI capabilities

### Development Features
- Comprehensive logging system with async capabilities
- Extensive test coverage for reliability
- Plugin architecture for extensibility (planned)
- Collaborative editing capabilities (planned)

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

- **Core Editor** - Text buffer, editing commands, cursor management
- **UI Layer** - User interface components built with Dear ImGui
- **AI Integration** - OpenAI API client, AI agent orchestration
- **File System** - Workspace management, file operations
- **Utilities** - Logging, error handling, performance monitoring
