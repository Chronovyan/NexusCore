# Diff and Merge Implementation Notes

## Overview

This document provides technical details about the implementation of text diff and merge capabilities in the AI-First TextEditor project. This feature was completed as part of Phase 3.3 (Editor Core Enhancements) in the project roadmap.

## Architecture

The diff and merge functionality follows a clean, interface-based architecture consistent with the rest of the project:

1. **Interfaces**: Clear interfaces define the capabilities and interactions
2. **Dependency Injection**: Services are registered and resolved through the DI framework
3. **Command Pattern**: User operations are encapsulated in command objects
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests verify functionality

## Core Components

### Interface Extensions

- Added methods to `IEditor` interface for diff and merge operations:
  - `showDiff`: Displays differences between texts
  - `diffWithCurrent`: Compares with current text
  - `diffWithFile`: Compares with file content
  - `mergeTexts`: Merges multiple texts
  - `mergeWithFile`: Merges with file content
  - `applyDiffChanges`: Applies diff changes to text
  - `resolveConflict`: Resolves merge conflicts

- Added methods to `IEditorServices` interface:
  - `getDiffEngine`: Returns the diff engine service
  - `getMergeEngine`: Returns the merge engine service

### Implementations

- Created `EditorDiffMerge.cpp` to implement the diff and merge methods for the `Editor` class
- Implemented methods in `Editor.cpp` to properly initialize diff and merge engines
- Created command classes:
  - `DiffCommand`: Compares current text with a file
  - `MergeCommand`: Merges current text with other files
- Created factory functions in `EditorDiffMergeCommands.h` for creating commands

### DI Framework Integration

- Created `DiffMergeModule` to register diff and merge services
- Updated `ApplicationModule` to include the `DiffMergeModule`
- Modified `EditorFactory` to inject diff and merge engines into the `Editor`
- Updated `EditorServices` to provide access to diff and merge engines

### Utilities

- Added helper methods in `Editor` class:
  - `getCurrentTextAsLines`: Converts current text to line vectors
  - `loadTextFromFile`: Loads file content as line vectors

## Testing

- Created `DiffMergeTest.cpp` with tests for:
  - Comparing the current document with a file
  - Merging the current document with other files
  - Verifying undo/redo functionality for merge operations

## Build Integration

- Updated main `CMakeLists.txt` to include new source files
- Updated `tests/CMakeLists.txt` to include the new test file
- Ensured proper dependency resolution during build

## Documentation

- Created `diff_merge_features.md` with detailed user documentation
- Updated project README to highlight the new capabilities
- Updated ROADMAP.md to mark the feature as completed
- Created this implementation notes document

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. Word-level diffing for more precise comparison
2. Visual diff and merge UI for interactive editing
3. Integration with version control systems
4. Support for external diff tools
5. Patch file generation and application

## Conclusion

The diff and merge capabilities have been successfully implemented following the project's architecture and design principles. The implementation provides a solid foundation for text comparison and merging while maintaining consistency with the rest of the codebase.
