# Editor Stability Principles

This document outlines key design principles and patterns enhancing the stability of the text editor, complementing specific concurrency measures detailed in `THREAD_SAFETY.MD`.

## Core Stability Patterns

### 1. Non-Recursive Locking (Internal Helpers)

To prevent deadlocks from re-entrant calls on an already-held mutex, a common pattern is:
- Public methods acquire a primary lock.
- They then call private `_nolock` suffixed helper methods for the actual logic, which operate without attempting to re-acquire the lock.

```cpp
// Conceptual Example in a Manager class
class ResourceManager {
public:
    void performOperation(ResourceID id) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(m_mutex);
        // ... pre-checks ...
        performOperation_nolock(id);
        // ... post-actions ...
    }

private:
    void performOperation_nolock(ResourceID id); // Assumes m_mutex is held
    std::mutex m_mutex;
};
```

### 2. Standardized Error Handling & Reporting

A consistent error handling strategy is crucial for stability.
- Use specific exception classes (e.g., `CriticalError`, `OperationFailedError`) to differentiate error types.
- Centralized error logging/reporting that includes context (e.g., module, thread ID, severity).
- Employ try-catch blocks around operations prone to failure, especially I/O or complex state changes.

```cpp
// Conceptual Error Handling
void processFile(const std::string& path) {
    try {
        // ... file operations ...
    } catch (const FileIOException& e) {
        ErrorHandler::log(Severity::Critical, "FileIO", "Failed to process file: " + path + ", " + e.what());
        // ... attempt recovery or safe shutdown ...
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        ErrorHandler::log(Severity::Error, "General", "Unexpected error processing file: " + path + ", " + e.what());
    }
}
```

### 3. Resource Management via RAII and Smart Pointers

Automatic resource management is fundamental to preventing leaks and dangling pointers, major sources of instability.
- **`std::unique_ptr`**: For exclusive ownership of resources (e.g., buffers, components).
- **`std::shared_ptr`**: For shared ownership where lifetimes are co-managed.
- Custom RAII wrappers for non-memory resources (e.g., file handles, system objects) ensure cleanup.

```cpp
// RAII for a custom resource
class RaiiFile {
    FILE* m_file = nullptr;
public:
    RaiiFile(const char* name, const char* mode) : m_file(fopen(name, mode)) {
        if (!m_file) throw std::runtime_error("Failed to open file");
    }
    ~RaiiFile() { if (m_file) fclose(m_file); }
    // Delete copy constructor/assignment, provide move constructor/assignment
    RaiiFile(const RaiiFile&) = delete;
    RaiiFile& operator=(const RaiiFile&) = delete;
    RaiiFile(RaiiFile&& other) noexcept : m_file(other.m_file) { other.m_file = nullptr; }
    RaiiFile& operator=(RaiiFile&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            if (m_file) fclose(m_file);
            m_file = other.m_file;
            other.m_file = nullptr;
        }
        return *this;
    }
    // Provide accessors as needed
    FILE* get() const { return m_file; }
};
```

### 4. Strict `const`-Correctness

Enforcing `const`-correctness helps prevent unintended state modifications, which can lead to subtle bugs and instability, especially in multi-threaded contexts.
- Methods that do not modify observable object state are marked `const`.
- Pass by `const&` or `const T*` when read-only access is sufficient.

```cpp
class DataModel {
public:
    // This method does not change DataModel's logical state
    size_t getItemCount() const;
    
    // This method might change internal caches but not logical state observable by clients
    std::string getItem(size_t index) const; 
};
```

## Stability Verification

Stability is ensured through a multi-faceted approach:
1.  **Targeted Unit Tests**: For individual components, covering edge cases and error conditions.
2.  **Deadlock Verification Tests**: Specific multi-threaded tests designed to provoke deadlocks by rapidly acquiring/releasing resources (e.g., creating/destroying `Editor` objects concurrently).
3.  **Stress Testing**: Subjecting the editor to prolonged, intensive operations (large files, rapid edits, frequent searches).
4.  **Sanitizers**: Utilizing AddressSanitizer (ASan) and ThreadSanitizer (TSan) during development and testing builds to automatically detect memory errors and data races.
5.  **Static Analysis**: Employing static analysis tools to identify potential bugs, code smells, and deviations from best practices.
6.  **Code Reviews**: Peer review process focusing on resource management, error handling, concurrency patterns, and adherence to `const`-correctness.

## Conclusion

These principles, combined with robust concurrency control (detailed in `THREAD_SAFETY.MD`), form the foundation for a stable and reliable text editor. Diligent application of RAII, disciplined error handling, `const`-correctness, and comprehensive, multi-layered testing are paramount.
