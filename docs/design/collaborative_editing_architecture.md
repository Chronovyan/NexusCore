# Collaborative Editing Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for implementing real-time collaborative editing in the AI-First TextEditor. The collaborative editing feature will allow multiple users to simultaneously edit the same document, see each other's cursors and selections, and communicate through an integrated chat system.

## Core Requirements

1. **Conflict-Free Editing**
   - Multiple users should be able to edit the same document simultaneously
   - Changes should be automatically merged without requiring manual conflict resolution
   - The system should maintain consistency across all clients

2. **Real-Time Cursor Sharing**
   - Users should see the cursor positions of other collaborators
   - Selections made by other users should be visible with user-specific highlighting
   - Cursor movement should be transmitted with minimal latency

3. **Integrated Chat**
   - Users should be able to communicate through text messages
   - Messages should be associated with specific users
   - Support for basic formatting (markdown)
   - Chat history should be preserved

4. **Security and Authentication**
   - Secure connections with WebSocket over TLS (WSS)
   - User authentication and session management
   - Permission control for documents (read/write access)

## Architecture

The collaborative editing system will be implemented using a client-server architecture with the following components:

### 1. Server Components

#### Collaboration Server
- WebSocket server to handle real-time communication
- Session management for clients
- Document state management
- CRDT operation processing
- Message broadcasting and routing

#### Document Store
- Persistent storage for document versions
- CRDT operation history
- User metadata and permissions

#### Chat Service
- Message processing and broadcasting
- Chat history storage
- User presence management

### 2. Client Components

#### Collaboration Client
- WebSocket client for communication with the server
- Local CRDT operations manager
- Change synchronization logic
- Cursor position tracking and broadcasting

#### Collaborative Text Buffer
- Extension of the existing ITextBuffer with CRDT capabilities
- Local change application
- Remote change integration

#### Collaborative UI Components
- Remote cursor visualization
- User presence indicators
- Collaborative editing status display

#### Chat Interface
- Message composition and display
- User presence visualization
- Notification system

## Data Flow

### Document Editing Flow

1. User makes an edit in the local editor
2. Edit is converted to a CRDT operation
3. Operation is applied locally to update the UI immediately
4. Operation is sent to the server
5. Server processes the operation and broadcasts to all connected clients
6. Other clients receive the operation
7. Operation is applied to each client's local document
8. UI is updated to reflect changes

### Cursor Sharing Flow

1. User moves cursor or selects text
2. Cursor/selection information is sent to the server
3. Server broadcasts cursor information to all clients
4. Other clients receive and display the remote cursor/selection

### Chat Message Flow

1. User composes and sends a message
2. Message is sent to the server
3. Server broadcasts the message to all clients in the session
4. Clients display the message in their chat interface

## Technical Implementation

### CRDT Implementation

We will implement Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to enable conflict-free editing. Specifically, we'll use the YATA algorithm (Yet Another Text Algorithm) which is designed for collaborative text editing:

1. **Document Structure**
   - The document will be represented as a sequence of CRDT characters
   - Each character will have a unique identifier, consisting of:
     - A unique client ID
     - A logical clock value
     - The actual character value
     - Metadata (formatting, etc.)

2. **Operations**
   - Insert: Add a new character at a specific position
   - Delete: Mark a character as deleted (tombstone)
   - Format: Apply formatting to a range of characters

3. **Consistency**
   - The CRDT algorithm ensures that concurrent operations can be applied in any order and still result in the same document state
   - Tombstones ensure that position identifiers remain stable

### WebSocket Server

We will implement a WebSocket server using one of the following libraries:

1. **Option A: WebSocket++**
   - C++ WebSocket implementation
   - Efficient and lightweight
   - Good integration with our existing C++ codebase

2. **Option B: Boost.Beast**
   - Part of Boost libraries
   - Comprehensive WebSocket and HTTP support
   - Well-documented and maintained

The server will handle:
- WebSocket connections and message routing
- Session management
- Document state synchronization
- Operation broadcasting

### Client-Server Protocol

The client-server communication will use a JSON-based protocol over WebSockets:

1. **Message Types**
   - `auth`: Authentication and session establishment
   - `sync`: Initial document synchronization
   - `op`: CRDT operation message
   - `cursor`: Cursor position update
   - `chat`: Chat message
   - `presence`: User presence update

2. **Message Format**
   ```json
   {
     "type": "op",
     "sessionId": "session123",
     "documentId": "doc456",
     "userId": "user789",
     "data": {
       "opType": "insert",
       "position": { "clientId": "user789", "clock": 42 },
       "value": "a",
       "metadata": { "bold": true }
     },
     "timestamp": 1634567890123
   }
   ```

### Integration with Existing Codebase

The collaborative editing system will integrate with the existing codebase through:

1. **Text Buffer Integration**
   - Extend `ITextBuffer` with a new implementation: `CollaborativeTextBuffer`
   - Implement CRDT operations in terms of the existing buffer operations
   - Use the existing command pattern for local changes

2. **Editor Integration**
   - Add collaboration-specific commands and services
   - Integrate with the existing editor UI
   - Use the dependency injection framework for service registration

3. **UI Integration**
   - Extend the editor UI to display remote cursors
   - Add a collaboration status panel
   - Implement the chat interface
