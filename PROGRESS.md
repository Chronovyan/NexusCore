# Text Editor Project Progress

## Completed Improvements (Phase 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and partial 1.4)

### Error Handling Enhancements
1. **EditorError.h**: Created a comprehensive error handling system with:
   - Specialized exception classes with severity levels
   - Structured error reporting
   - Fallback mechanisms for critical operations

2. **typeText/typeChar**: Improved these methods with:
   - Proper exception handling
   - Fallback to character-by-character processing
   - Meaningful error messages

3. **Command Management**: Enhanced with:
   - Command history pruning to limit memory usage
   - Thread-safe operations with mutex protection
   - Compound command support for atomic operations
   - Improved undo/redo reliability

4. **Syntax Highlighting**: Completely overhauled with:
   - Visible line prioritization for highlighting
   - Efficient incremental highlighting that only processes modified lines
   - Line-level caching with timestamp-based invalidation
   - Timeout mechanism to prevent hanging during long operations
   - Memory-efficient cache pruning to avoid excessive memory usage

## Next Steps

1. **Text Input Handling** (Remaining Phase 1.4):
   - Improve cursor positioning logic
   - Enhance selection and clipboard functionality
   - Consider adding efficient line wrapping

2. **Testing & Validation** (Phase 2):
   - Create performance benchmarks
   - Test with various file sizes
   - Stress test operations
   - Validate memory usage

## Testing Plan
To validate our improvements, we should:

1. Create a large test file (5-10MB)
2. Test typing performance
3. Test search/replace operations
4. Test syntax highlighting performance
5. Monitor memory usage during extended sessions
6. Verify undo/redo with large histories

## Current Issues

The editor now has better error handling, command management, and syntax highlighting, but we still need to address:

1. Cursor positioning and selection functionality
2. Memory efficiency for large files
3. Comprehensive testing suite

## Next Meeting Focus
- Review syntax highlighting implementation results
- Discuss cursor positioning and selection improvements
- Plan for testing methodology
