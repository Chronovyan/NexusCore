# Key Milestones Achieved

This document highlights significant improvements and foundational work completed in the text editor project.

## Core System Enhancements

### 1. Robust Error Handling Framework
- Implemented a comprehensive error handling system (`EditorError.h` and related modules).
- Features specialized exception classes, structured reporting, and defined severity levels.
- *Impact: Enhanced stability by providing graceful recovery and clear diagnostics for operational failures.*

### 2. Optimized Text Operations
- Refined core text manipulation methods (e.g., `typeText`, `typeChar`).
- Ensured proper exception handling and fallback mechanisms for complex inputs.
- *Impact: Improved reliability and predictability of text editing functions.*

### 3. Advanced Command Management
- Overhauled the command system for efficiency and reliability.
- Includes memory-conscious history pruning, thread-safe operations, and support for atomic compound commands.
- *Impact: Stable undo/redo functionality and reduced memory footprint during long editing sessions.*

### 4. Performant Syntax Highlighting Engine
- Re-architected syntax highlighting for speed and efficiency.
- Key features: incremental updates (highlights only modified lines), visible line prioritization, line-level caching with timestamp-based invalidation, and protective timeouts for long operations.
- *Impact: Significantly improved UI responsiveness, especially with large files or complex syntax, and prevention of editor hangs during highlighting.*
