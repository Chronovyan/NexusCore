# TextEditor (C++17)

A command-line C++17 text editor focused on stability and core editing features.

## Key Features & Status

- ‚úÖ Core text buffer, cursor navigation, text manipulation (insert/delete)
- ‚úÖ Selection, clipboard (copy/cut/paste), word operations
- ‚úÖ File I/O (save/load)
- ‚úÖ Search & Replace
- ‚úÖ Automated testing framework (`ctest` / batch scripts)
- üîÑ Syntax highlighting (In Progress)
- ‚è≥ Basic Graphical UI (Planned)

## Building & Running

### Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler (MSVC, GCC, Clang)
- CMake (version 3.10+ recommended)

### Build Instructions

Primary method (CMake):
```bash
# From project root
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . # Or: make / msbuild TextEditor.sln (depending on generator)
# Executable typically in: build/src/TextEditor, build/bin/TextEditor, or build/TextEditor
```
(For more detailed instructions, see [docs/BUILD_AND_TEST.md](docs/BUILD_AND_TEST.md).)

Alternative (Windows Batch for building and testing):
```batch
REM From project root - ensures clean build and runs tests
build_run_test.bat 
REM Executable in: bin/TextEditor.exe (if produced by this script)
```
For just building with batch scripts, see `build.bat`.

### Running Tests

Using CTest (after CMake build, from `build` directory):
```bash
ctest -C Debug # Or Release, etc.
```
(For more detailed instructions, see [docs/BUILD_AND_TEST.md](docs/BUILD_AND_TEST.md).)

Alternative (Windows Batch for unit tests):
```batch
REM From project root
build_and_run_unit_tests.bat
```

## Basic Usage (CLI)

Launch the editor from its build location (e.g., `./build/src/TextEditor` or `bin\\TextEditor.exe`).
It provides an interactive command prompt. Key commands:

| Command                                      | Description                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `load <filename>`                            | Load file into buffer.                           |
| `save <filename>`                            | Save buffer to file.                             |
| `add <text>`                                 | Add text as a new line at the end.               |
| `insert <line_idx> <text>`                   | Insert text at specified 0-based line index.     |
| `delete <line_idx>`                          | Delete line at 0-based index.                    |
| `view`                                       | Print buffer with cursor.                        |
| `setcursor <line> <col>`                     | Set cursor position.                             |
| `type <text>`                                | Insert text at cursor.                           |
| `search <term>` / `find <term>`              | Find text.                                       |
| `replace <search_term> <replace_text>`       | Find and replace first occurrence.               |
| `replaceall <search_term> <replace_text>`    | Replace all occurrences.                         |
| `help`                                       | Show all commands.                               |
| `quit` / `exit`                              | Exit the editor.                                 |

(Use the `help` command for a comprehensive list of all available operations.)
