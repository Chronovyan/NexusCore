# Comprehensive Test Plan

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the TextEditor project. Its purpose is to guide efforts in achieving thorough test coverage, ensuring stability and reliability, preventing regressions (functional and performance), and consolidating existing testing frameworks.

## 2. Current Testing Landscape
The test suite currently uses multiple testing approaches:

*   **GoogleTest Framework:**
    *   Used in newer tests (e.g., `memory_leak_test.cpp`, `editor_file_io_test.cpp`). *(Note: `fuzz_testing.cpp` was previously mentioned but is not currently present).*
    *   Provides structured test assertions and reporting.
    *   Supports test discovery and filtering.
    *   **This is the primary framework ಎಲ್ಲಾ new tests should use.**
*   **Custom Framework:**
    *   Defined in `TestFramework.h`.
    *   Used in older tests (e.g., `CommandLogicTests.cpp`).
    *   Limited reporting capabilities.
    *   **These tests are candidates for migration to GoogleTest.**
*   **Manual CLI Tests:**
    *   Various standalone `.cpp` test files executed via scripts, with manual output verification.
    *   Limited automation and self-verification.
    *   **These tests are candidates for conversion to GoogleTest.**

## 3. Overall Testing Goals
*   Achieve comprehensive test coverage for all critical components and features.
*   Ensure a high degree of stability and reliability in the editor.
*   Prevent functional regressions as new features are added or code is refactored.
*   Prevent performance regressions in key operations.
*   Consolidate onto a primary testing framework (GoogleTest) for consistency and better tooling.

## 4. Identified Test Coverage Gaps & Areas for Improvement

### 4.1. Fuzz Testing
*   **Status:** Not Implemented.
*   **Description:** Introduce fuzz testing to automatically discover edge cases, crashes, and potential vulnerabilities by providing unexpected or malformed data to various input points.
*   **Target Areas:**
    *   File loading routines (`Editor::openFile` with diverse file contents).
    *   Command parsing logic (`Editor::processCommand` with varied command strings).
    *   Text input APIs (`Editor::typeText` and similar methods).
*   **Priority:** High.

### 4.2. CppHighlighter (Syntax Highlighting)
*   **Status:** Basic line-by-line coverage exists; requires enhancement for complex scenarios.
*   **Description:** Expand tests for `CppHighlighter` to cover multi-line constructs and contextual awareness critical for accurate C++ highlighting.
*   **Target Areas:**
    *   Multi-line block comments.
    *   Multi-line preprocessor directives.
    *   Multi-line string literals (if supported by the language/highlighter).
    *   Contextual highlighting (e.g., correctly identifying syntax within an active multi-line comment or string).
*   **Priority:** High.

### 4.3. SyntaxHighlightingManager
*   **Status:** Basic error handling tested; core logic and performance features need more comprehensive tests.
*   **Description:** Develop tests for the manager's caching mechanisms, state management, and any performance-related features.
*   **Target Areas:**
    *   Cache logic: hits, misses, correct invalidation (`invalidateLine`, `invalidateAllLines`), and cache cleanup/memory reclamation.
    *   Enabled/Disabled states: Verify behavior when highlighting is toggled.
    *   Timeout/Cancellation mechanisms: If these are manager-level responsibilities.
    *   Concurrency: Test for thread safety if the manager's operations (e.g., cache access/updates) can be concurrent.
*   **Priority:** Medium.

### 4.4. Editor Facade Methods
*   **Status:** Currently implicitly tested by some CLI-driven tests; explicit GoogleTest unit tests are needed.
*   **Description:** Create focused GoogleTest unit tests for the public API of the `Editor` class to ensure its core logic can be tested in isolation and its contracts are well-defined.
*   **Priority:** Medium (Part of Test Consolidation effort).

### 4.5. File I/O Operations
*   **Status:** Good core coverage exists (`editor_file_io_test.cpp`); advanced cases and features could be added.
*   **Description:** Enhance file I/O tests to cover a wider range of scenarios and potential editor features.
*   **Target Areas:**
    *   File Encodings: Handling files with different encodings (e.g., UTF-8 with/without BOM, UTF-16).
    *   Advanced Filesystem Errors: Behavior with disk full, more complex permission issues (beyond simple read-only). (Note: Some of these may be hard to reliably automate in unit tests).
    *   Atomic Saves / Backup File Creation: If these features are implemented or planned.
    *   More Rigorous Large File Content Verification: Beyond checking a few lines, consider checksums or full comparisons if feasible.
*   **Priority:** Lower.

### 4.6. Performance Testing
*   **Status:** Benchmarks exist (`PerformanceBenchmark.cpp`); formal regression tests are desirable.
*   **Description:** Establish formal performance regression tests that fail if key operations (file load, search, typing, highlighting) degrade beyond a defined threshold.
*   **Priority:** Lower.

### 4.7. Memory Usage
*   **Status:** Basic leak tests exist (`memory_leak_test.cpp`); extended session/soak tests could be beneficial.
*   **Description:** Supplement existing memory leak tests with longer-running "soak tests" to identify memory issues that only manifest over extended usage periods.
*   **Priority:** Lower.

## 5. Test Consolidation & Migration Strategy
(Adapted from the original Test Framework Consolidation Plan)

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions
1.  **Keep GoogleTest as the Primary Framework:**
    *   Continue using GoogleTest for all new tests.
    *   Reuse test organization patterns established in existing GoogleTest files.
2.  **Document Test Coverage (Ongoing):**
    *   Maintain a clear understanding of functionality covered by tests (this document contributes to that).
    *   Identify and prioritize conversion/creation of tests for unique or critical functionality not yet covered by GoogleTest.

### Phase 2: Migration Steps
1.  **Convert CLI Tests to GoogleTest:**
    *   Start with tests that have clear success/failure criteria.
    *   For each test:
        *   Create a new GoogleTest test class/fixture.
        *   Move setup/initialization code to `SetUp()` methods.
        *   Convert manual output validation to GoogleTest assertions (e.g., `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`).
        *   Integrate into the `runTests` executable (or equivalent CTest discovery).
2.  **Refactor Custom Framework (`TestFramework.h`) Tests:**
    *   Where possible, migrate test logic directly to GoogleTest.
    *   For complex test scenarios that are difficult to untangle, consider creating adapter wrappers to run them under GoogleTest initially.
    *   Preserve unique test logic while standardizing assertions and reporting via GoogleTest.
3.  **Create Helper Utilities & Test Fixtures:**
    *   Develop common setup code for editor test initialization within GoogleTest fixtures.
    *   Create test data generators or helper functions for commonly needed test data.
    *   Implement common custom assertions or helper functions for validating editor state if needed.

### Phase 3: Cleanup
1.  **Remove Redundant Tests:**
    *   Once functionality is confirmed to be covered by robust GoogleTest cases, remove older, duplicate tests (from CLI or custom framework).
    *   Maintain a mapping of old to new tests for reference during the transition if helpful.
2.  **Standardize Test File Organization:**
    *   Group GoogleTest files by component or functionality (e.g., `textbuffer_tests.cpp`, `command_tests.cpp`, `highlighting_tests/`).
    *   Use consistent naming patterns for test files and test cases.
    *   Consider creating subdirectories within `tests/` if the number of test files becomes large.
3.  **Update Build System (CMake):**
    *   Ensure `tests/CMakeLists.txt` correctly discovers and builds all GoogleTest executables.
    *   Consider using CTest labels or categories for running focused subsets of tests (e.g., `unit`, `integration`, `performance`).
    *   Improve test result reporting and visualization if possible.

## 6. Testing Value Preservation
During consolidation and enhancement efforts, the following values must be maintained:

1.  **Test Coverage:** No existing functionality should lose test coverage during migration. The goal is to increase and improve coverage.
2.  **Test Clarity:** Tests should remain readable, maintainable, and focused on verifying specific behaviors.
3.  **Runtime Efficiency:** While comprehensive testing is vital, tests should run efficiently enough not to become a major bottleneck in the development cycle.
4.  **Build System Integration:** All automated tests should be discoverable and runnable via CTest.

## 7. Prioritization & Roadmap for Addressing Gaps (Summary)

*   **High Priority:**
    *   Implement Fuzz Testing.
    *   Enhance `CppHighlighter` tests (multi-line, contextual).
    *   Begin Test Consolidation (migrating CLI and Custom Framework tests to GoogleTest).
*   **Medium Priority:**
    *   Comprehensive `SyntaxHighlightingManager` tests (cache, states, concurrency).
    *   Explicit GoogleTest unit tests for `Editor` facade methods.
*   **Lower Priority (but still valuable):**
    *   Advanced File I/O tests (encodings, specific error conditions).
    *   Formal Performance Regression tests.
    *   Extended Memory Soak tests.
