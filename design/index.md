# Design Documentation

This directory contains architectural and design documentation for the AI-First TextEditor, including system architecture, design patterns, and technical decisions.

## Architecture

- [Collaborative Editing Architecture](collaborative_editing_architecture.md) - Design of the real-time collaborative editing system
- [System Architecture](../development/ARCHITECTURE.md) - High-level system design and component interactions
- [Codebase Structure](../development/CODEBASE_STRUCTURE.md) - Organization of the codebase and key components

## Design Patterns

The AI-First TextEditor leverages several design patterns to ensure maintainability and extensibility:

1. **Command Pattern** - For undo/redo functionality
2. **Observer Pattern** - For UI updates and event handling
3. **Strategy Pattern** - For pluggable components
4. **Dependency Injection** - For testability and modularity

## Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between components
2. **Testability** - All components are designed for easy testing
3. **Extensibility** - Designed to support plugins and extensions
4. **Performance** - Optimized for large files and real-time collaboration

## Getting Started with Development

For developers looking to understand the design:

1. Start with the [System Architecture](../development/ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. Review the [Codebase Structure](../development/CODEBASE_STRUCTURE.md)
3. Check out the [Collaborative Editing](collaborative_editing_architecture.md) documentation for real-time features

## Contributing to Design

When proposing design changes:

1. Document the current behavior and proposed changes
2. Consider backward compatibility
3. Include performance implications
4. Update relevant documentation

For major design changes, please open an issue for discussion before submitting a pull request.
