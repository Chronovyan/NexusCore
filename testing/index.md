## Getting Started with Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
./tests/RunAllTests

# Run specific test suite
./tests/RunAllTests --gtest_filter=TestSuiteName*

# Run with detailed output
./tests/RunAllTests --gtest_output="xml:test_results.xml"
```

### Writing Tests

1. Add new test files to the appropriate test directory
2. Follow the existing test patterns and naming conventions
3. Include proper test fixtures and assertions
4. Document test cases clearly

## Overview

The AI-First TextEditor uses a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure reliability and performance. This includes unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks, and stress tests.

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **Performance Tests**: Measure and verify performance characteristics
4. **Stress Tests**: Validate behavior under extreme conditions

For more information, see the [Testing Guide](../development/testing_guide.md).
