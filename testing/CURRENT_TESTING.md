# Current Testing Focus

## Test Execution Plan - Phase 1: Core Functionality

### 1. Test Environment Setup
- [ ] Verify build system configuration
- [ ] Set up test data directory
- [ ] Configure test logging

### 2. Core Text Editing Tests

#### 2.1 Basic Text Operations
- [ ] Test single-line text insertion
- [ ] Test multi-line text insertion
- [ ] Test text deletion (single and multiple characters)
- [ ] Test line operations (insert, delete, split, join)

#### 2.2 Selection and Clipboard

- [ ] Test copy/paste operations
- [ ] Test cut operations
- [ ] Test clipboard integration

#### 2.3 Undo/Redo Functionality
- [ ] Test single-level undo/redo
- [ ] Test multi-level undo/redo
- [ ] Test undo/redo with multiple operations
- [ ] Test undo/redo boundary conditions

### 3. Test Execution

#### 3.1 Running Tests
```bash
# Navigate to build directory
cd build

# Run all tests
ctest --output-on-failure

# Run specific test
./tests/RunAllTests --gtest_filter=TextBufferTest.*
```

#### 3.2 Expected Output
- All tests should pass with no failures
- Detailed logging of test execution
- Performance metrics for each test case
