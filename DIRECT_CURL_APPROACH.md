# Direct libcurl Approach for OpenAI API Client

This document outlines the approach of using libcurl directly for the OpenAI API client instead of relying on the CPR (C++ Requests) library.

## Why Switch from CPR to Direct libcurl?

There are several advantages to using libcurl directly:

1. **Less Dependency Complexity**: Using libcurl directly reduces the number of dependencies in the project.
2. **Better Control**: Direct libcurl usage provides more fine-grained control over HTTP requests.
3. **Wider Platform Support**: libcurl is widely supported across platforms and has excellent compatibility.
4. **Potential Performance Benefits**: Removing a layer of abstraction could lead to performance improvements.
5. **Simpler Build Process**: Direct libcurl integration is more straightforward in CMake.

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes:

1. **Replacement of CPR with libcurl**:
   - Remove CPR dependency from the build system
   - Add direct libcurl dependency
   - Replace CPR API calls with equivalent libcurl calls

2. **OpenAIClientImpl Changes**:
   - Use CURL handle directly for HTTP requests 
   - Implement proper error handling and resource cleanup
   - Maintain the same interface for OpenAI_API_Client users

3. **CMake Changes**:
   - Remove CPR subdirectory inclusion
   - Add FindCURL package
   - Link against CURL::libcurl instead of cpr::cpr

4. **WriteCallback Function**:
   - Implement a callback function for libcurl to collect response data

## Testing the Implementation

To test the new implementation:

1. Run the `test_openai_client.bat` script which will:
   - Configure the project with CMake
   - Build the OpenAIClientTest executable
   - Run the test with your OpenAI API key

2. Verify that API calls function correctly
   - Check that requests are properly sent
   - Verify that responses are correctly parsed
   - Ensure error handling works as expected

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the direct libcurl implementation:

1. Add SSL certificate verification options
2. Implement connection pooling for improved performance
3. Add support for streaming responses
4. Implement request retries with backoff
5. Add more detailed error reporting

## Conclusion

Using libcurl directly provides a more streamlined approach to making HTTP requests to the OpenAI API. This approach reduces dependencies, gives more control, and potentially improves performance while maintaining the same functionality provided by the original CPR-based implementation.
