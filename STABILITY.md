# Text Editor Stability Improvements

This document outlines the stability improvements made to the text editor to address resource deadlocks and improve thread safety.

## Resource Deadlock Issues

The text editor was experiencing resource deadlocks, which manifested in two ways:
1. Initial crash when constructing the `Editor` object in `main.cpp`
2. "Resource deadlock would occur" exceptions related to the `SyntaxHighlighterRegistry` singleton

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Non-Recursive Mutex Issue in SyntaxHighlightingManager

- Created private `invalidateAllLines_nolock()` method that doesn't acquire the mutex
- Modified `setBuffer()` and `setEnabled()` to call this lock-free version 
- Added robust error handling with try-catch blocks to prevent exceptions from escaping

### 2. Thread Safety in SyntaxHighlighterRegistry

- Added thread-safe mutex in the registry class
- Added proper error handling around all registry operations
- Ensured safe initialization of the singleton instance with Meyers Singleton pattern
- Added null pointer checks throughout the code
- Standardized error handling and reporting

### 3. Added Missing Implementation

- Added the non-const implementation of `getHighlightingStyles` method in `SyntaxHighlightingManager.cpp`
- Ensured the `SyntaxHighlighter.cpp` file is properly included in the build process

### 4. Testing

- Created a dedicated deadlock verification test (`DeadlockTest.cpp`)
- Added multi-threaded stress testing to verify thread safety
- Test runs multiple threads that create and destroy Editor objects simultaneously
- Added proper timeout handling and thread tracking

## Verification

All changes have been verified through:
1. Successful build of the main application
2. Passing deadlock verification test
3. Interactive testing of the editor functionality

## Remaining Warnings

Some compiler warnings remain but do not affect functionality:
- Unreferenced parameter 'lineIndex' in SyntaxHighlighter.h
- Conversion from 'int' to 'char' in std::transform
- Unreferenced 'currentPos' variables in Editor.cpp

These warnings can be addressed in future maintenance tasks but do not affect the stability of the application.

## Conclusion

These improvements have significantly enhanced the stability and thread safety of the text editor. It is now more robust against concurrency issues and potential deadlocks during initialization and usage.
